ECAL Endcap tapered PbWO4 crystal
==========

Single PbWO4 crystal of CMS EE tapered geometry, read-out using a PMT/VPT like photodetector on the rear face.

Possibility to add a front photodetector to study double-side read-out configuration.

Software allows to study the light collection efficiency inside the crystal as well as the energy resolution and linearity of response to high energy particles by factorizing the processes of:
1. shower development + energy deposition
2. convolution with look-up table of light collection efficiency curves for different levels of radiation damage
 
Effects of containment and beam spot size can also be investigated.
